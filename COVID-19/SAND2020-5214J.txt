In these simulations, an adaptive time stepping strategy is used.
The pulse lasts between 0.1 and 0.05 seconds (10 m/s and 20 m/s, respectively).

After the pulse is complete, the adaptive time step is allowed to increase
as the confuguration is that of queiscent.

The movies hold a different SAND number than the presentation; both are UUR.
